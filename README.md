# Codewars
Codewars is an educational community for computer programming. On the platform, software developers train on programming challenges known as kata. 
These discrete programming exercises train a range of skills in a variety of programming languages, and are completed within an online 
integrated development environment.

// Usually, I use Python, C ++, or JavaScript to do code challenge :D
